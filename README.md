# Google Summer of Code 2025 — DeepMind (Jevon Mao)

This repository serves as the master record of my work during **Google Summer of Code 2025** with **Google DeepMind**.

## Project Overview

### Original Proposal
The project was initially proposed as:

> *The creation of a comprehensive Postman Workspace tailored for Google’s Gemini API suite. It would provide developers with a robust, user-friendly hub to explore, integrate, and test Gemini’s capabilities, significantly lowering the barrier to entry for new Gemini developers.*

### Project Pivot
After discussions with my mentor, we mutually decided to pivot the project.  
Instead of a Postman Workspace, I focused on **developing Swift iOS application examples** for the Google Gemini APIs.  
The pivot aligned better with developer needs and highlighted practical, hands-on integrations.

## Deliverables

I implemented and shipped **two demo iOS applications**, each showcasing a different capability of the Gemini API suite.

1. **[Gemini Story Generator](https://github.com/jevonmao/Gemini-Story-Generator)**  
   - Uses the **Gemini LLM API** to generate original fictional stories.  
   - Provides an interactive iOS interface for creative writing and experimentation.  

2. **[Gemini Image Describe](https://github.com/jevonmao/Gemini-Image-Describe)**  
   - Leverages the **multimodal capabilities of Gemini**.  
   - Allows users to upload any image and receive descriptive text generated by Gemini.
